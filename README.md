Please Note:
Zillow.com just recently started blocking our html parser requests, so your searches may return no results. Because of this, we have downloaded the html source code from zillow search results for several locations. Try searching for city "baltimore", states "california" or "hawaii", neighborhood "upper east side, manhattan" or zipcode "20723". We appologize for the inconvenience and have screenshots in our documents showing evidence of it working previously.
